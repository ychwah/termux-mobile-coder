## About PHPMyAdmin

PHPMyAdmin is a free, open-source web-based tool written in PHP that allows users to manage MySQL and MariaDB databases through a user-friendly graphical interface. It simplifies tasks like creating, modifying, and deleting databases, tables, and records, as well as executing SQL queries, importing/exporting data, and managing user permissions.
